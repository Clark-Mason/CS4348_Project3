Wednesday, November 27 2024, 21:43 - First Devlog Entry, I have idnetfied that I want to do this project in th eorder of orthoganality much like all other projects done. Some key components I've identfied for the working of this program GUI,Index File, Functions. Components supporting modularity are GUI and Index File as the functions should only be performed on the index file. My approach will be to first get the Index File component working as if that is function without infection of GUI i know where my issues lie. First order of business should be creation,writing, and reading as those matter much more than other functions.
