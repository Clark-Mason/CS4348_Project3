Wednesday, November 27 2024, 21:43 - First Devlog Entry, I have idnetfied that I want to do this project in th eorder of orthoganality much like all other projects done. Some key components I've identfied for the working of this program GUI,Index File, Functions. Components supporting modularity are GUI and Index File as the functions should only be performed on the index file. My approach will be to first get the Index File component working as if that is function without infection of GUI i know where my issues lie. First order of business should be creation,writing, and reading as those matter much more than other functions.

Wednesday, November 27 2024, 22:26 - Second Devlog Entry, I think I have set up the structure for how I want to progress. After some thinking and deliberation I have decided for index_file.py to be my main entry point to the actual program logic so with that in mind it should be in command of btree.py but shouldn't perform logic on the btree like btree.py I think I mainly chose this structure to support OOP as it would probably make more sense for the GUI to be the entry point I'll most definetly reflect on this tomorrow I have also identfied that I need another class to handle the creation and open operation logic so I will probably shift the index_file.py to handle that logic and the gui.py to be the entry point instead as it amkes more sense structurally. But for now I am done with this session and will use this devlog to mkove forward tomorrow

Monday, December 2 2024, 15:19 - Third Devlog Entry, today I am going to aim to complete the gui.py and index_file.py I haven't had much new thoughts since the last time i'm gonna restructure the code to where the gui.py is the entry point to the prograam. I plan to implment all the commands for the gui even if it's practically skeleton code without the btree.py I want to test the gui.py and index_file.py. Goal for this session is to get both up and working

Monday, December 2 2024, 16:23 -  Fourth Devlog Entry, gui and index_file up and running tested that index files could be created opened quit then opened again i'm going to go think more about how everythign will integrate with the btree.py file as that will be the biggest headache of this projefct assuredly.

Saturday, December 7 2024, 11:36 - Fifth Devlog Entry, this week was finals week and of course I get cursed with Covid i've been so delayed in this project and am upset with my past self for not getting this done in a prompt manner I will devote a majority of my day to complete this project as I still have to complete the 4337 project although that one has seen more progress.

Saturday, December 7 2024, 2018 - Sixth Devlog Entry, I"VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PORJECT NEARLY THE ENTIRE DAY HOW IS ME TAKING A BREAK JUST GOING TO WORK ON THE 4337 PROJECT AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT ONE IS ALMOST DONE THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART IS I GOT THIS PROJECT TO WORK FOR A BIT THEN I OPENED A CORRUPTED FILE AND IT DIDNT WORK AND YOU KNOW WHAT I TOOK THAT ON THE CHIN MOVED FORWARD AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED FOR A BIT AND I ASKED MY FRIEND "DOES THIS PASS ALL TEST CASES?" IT DIDN'T WORK WITH SPLITTING OMG AND THE BEST PART OF THAT IS AFTER WORKING ON IT FOR A FEW MORE HOURS MY WORK JUST DETERIORATED IT COULDNT DO ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS BEFORE AND SOMEHOW STARTED PRODUCING INFINITE LOOPS ITS NOT EVEN WORTH COMMITING THAT BRANCH AT THIS POINT IM STARTING OVER WITH A TOP TO BOTTOM APPROACH LIKE I PLANNED WITH MORE RIGOROUS TESTING AND FUZZERS I WILL USE UNIT TESTING TO MY ADVANTAGE. MARK MY WORDS I WILL FINISH THS TOMORROW!
